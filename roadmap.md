# Backend Development Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step process for developing a FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy, based on our existing PostgreSQL schema.

## Project Goals
- Create a robust API for document management
- Implement efficient database operations
- Handle PDF processing and text analysis
- Provide secure and scalable endpoints for frontend consumption

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
When starting this phase, ask about:
- Project structure setup
- Virtual environment configuration
- Initial dependencies
- Database connection setup
- Basic FastAPI application structure

### Phase 2: Database Integration
When starting this phase, ask about:
- SQLAlchemy model creation from existing schema
- Alembic migration setup
- Database connection pooling
- Model relationships and foreign keys
- Testing database connections

### Phase 3: Core API Development
When starting this phase, ask about:
- Basic CRUD endpoint implementation
- Request/Response models with Pydantic
- API versioning strategy
- Error handling patterns
- Middleware setup

### Phase 4: Document Processing
When starting this phase, ask about:
- S3 integration for PDFs
- File upload handling
- Text extraction and processing
- Chunking strategies
- Vector embeddings implementation

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
When starting this phase, ask about:
- Authentication implementation
- Background task processing
- Caching strategies
- Rate limiting
- API documentation

## Suggested Questions for Each Step

### Foundation Questions
1. "How should I structure my FastAPI project for scalability?"
2. "What essential dependencies should I include in my requirements.txt?"
3. "How do I set up my development environment?"

### Database Questions
1. "How do I convert my existing PostgreSQL schema to SQLAlchemy models?"
2. "What's the best way to handle database migrations?"
3. "How should I structure my database queries?"

### API Questions
1. "What's the best practice for organizing API routes?"
2. "How should I handle data validation?"
3. "What security measures should I implement?"

### Processing Questions
1. "How should I handle file uploads?"
2. "What's the best way to process PDFs?"
3. "How do I implement efficient text chunking?"

## Best Practices to Consider
- Always ask about error handling
- Request examples for complex implementations
- Ask for testing strategies
- Consider scalability implications
- Focus on security best practices

## Note
This is a living document that will evolve as we progress through the development process. Each phase builds upon the previous one, and we can adjust the roadmap based on specific needs and challenges that arise.
